# Bit React Tutorial Install

> This project is a bare-bones [Create React App][2], used to follow the [Bit React Tutorial][3].

This particular repo was created to install the **Bit** component created and exported by [**Bit**'s official React Tutorial repo][4].

If you look at the short commit history, you'll see that the component was originally imported direcrly as a dependency. **Bit** was later initialized in the repo, bringing it in, so we could make changes to the component and export it back to the component's **Bit** collection.

Not all steps are obvious only by looking and the code and commit messages, the steps here are [taken half-way through the tutorial][5].
